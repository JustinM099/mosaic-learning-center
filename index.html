      <h2>Owner/Teacher</h2>

      <h5>My name is Christine Meredith. I have been working in early childhood education for the past two decades and
        am making my dreams a reality by opening my own small preschool.</h5>
      <p>I am a mother of two young boys, and I thought that this would be the perfect way to fulfill my dreams while
        still spending the quality time with them that I love.</p>

      <p>I have grown so much in my education and passion for teaching over the years, and I can’t wait to share it all
        with your children.</p>

      <p>I graduated from the University of Washington with my teaching degree while working in early childhood
        education, and I never left.
        I rediscovered Montessori and quickly started working to become certified. I have my Montessori certification
        for infants and toddlers as well as primary (2.5-5 years) classrooms.
        My career has given me many wonderful opportunities over the years, and I can’t wait to use all of the knowledge
        and wisdom that I gained in my own school.</p>
      <strong>Thank you so much for your interest in Mosaic Learning Center. I'm eager to talk with you.</strong>

      <h2>Montessori Method</h5>
      <p>
          The Montessori method is an educational philosophy developed by Dr. Maria Montessori. Her basic principle was to “follow the child”. The Montessori method emphasizes independence, freedom with limits, and respect for the child. A Montessori classroom is carefully prepared to allow the child to work independently and allow for the joy of self-discovery.
      </p>
      <h2>RIE Philosophy</h5>
      <p>
          The RIE philosophy was developed by Magda Gerber. RIE stands for Resources of Infant Educators. This philosophy believes that parents and caretakers must have respect for children, and must trust that children are natural inventors, explorers, and self-learners. Respect is the cornerstone of the RIE philosophy.
      </p>
      <h2>Our Philosophy</h5>
      <p>
          Mosaic Learning Center's philosophy is to guide each child, help them grow, and follow their natural curiosity while giving them the opportunity to learn. We respect each child's voice and will listen to what they have to say while answering their questions and helping discover the answers together. We believe that the way that we live and exist on the planet is important. We believe in getting outside and exploring the world while working hard to reduce our footprint and the waste that we make. We promote love for the Earth, animals, and our fellow humans.
